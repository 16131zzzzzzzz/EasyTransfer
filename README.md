ðŸ‘‰**EXPERIENCE NOW: [EasyTransfer](https://file.ch3nyang.top/)**

EasyTransfer is a free, simple, and easy-to-use P2P file transfer tool. You only need to visit a simple web page to connect to **any device** in **any network** using a device code.

It is built using webRTC, **no need to scan codes**, **no need to share URL links**, **no need to upload files to the server**.

## How to use

1. Visit [EasyTransfer](https://file.ch3nyang.top/) on the two devices where you need to transfer files.
2. Enter the four-digit device code of any device into the device code input box of the other device and click the connect button.
3. After waiting for the connection to succeed, you can drag and drop the file to the file area on the web page, or click the file area to select the file. Supports sending multiple files at once.

## Notes

- Encrypted transmission is under development. Currently, there may be a risk of signaling and data leakage. Please do not transfer private files.
- This project is hosted on a free server. Please do not abuse it.

## Self-deployment

1. [Fork](https://github.com/WCY-dt/EasyTransfer/fork) this project.
2. Import the entire project into [glitch](https://glitch.com/) or your own server.
3. Modify `signalServerUrl` and `iceServers` in [`./client/e2e/connectCore.js`](https://github.com/WCY-dt/EasyTransfer/blob/main/client/e2e/connectCore.js) to your own addresses.
4. Open GitHub Pages and select the `gh-pages` branch as the source.
