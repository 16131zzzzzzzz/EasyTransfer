![Sample](./example.png)

EasyTransfer is a free, anonymous, encrypted, and easy-to-use E2EE file transfer tool. You only need to visit a simple web page to connect to **any device** in **any network** using a device code.

It is built using webRTC and Vue.js, and there is

- **NO** need to install any software
- **NO** need to register an account
- **NO** need to scan QR codes
- **NO** need to share URL links
- **NO** need to upload files to the server[^1]
- **NO** need to worry about the network environment

## How to use

1. Visit [EasyTransfer](https://file.ch3nyang.top/) on the two devices where you need to transfer files.
2. Enter the four-digit device code of any device into the device code input box of the other device and click the connect button.
3. After waiting for the connection to succeed, you can drag and drop the file to the file area on the web page, or click the file area to select the file. Supports sending multiple files at once.
4. In the settings, you can customize the STUN server and TURN server, or specify the maximum number of connections.
